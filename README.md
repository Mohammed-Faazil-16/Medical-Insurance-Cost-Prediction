Medical-Insurance-Cost-Prediction involves developing a regression model to forecast medical insurance costs based on patient demographics, lifestyle factors, and health indicators. Utilizing numpy and pandas for data preprocessing and sklearn for model development, the project aims to predict insurance premiums accurately. By analyzing variables such as age, smoking status, pre-existing conditions, and geographic location, the model provides insurance companies with insights into the expected healthcare expenses of policyholders. This predictive capability supports insurers in pricing policies competitively while managing financial risks associated with healthcare claims and coverage.
